## Author: Joseph Simonian

## Abstract:

Modern research papers involve more computational methods than ever before, with researchers in a variety of fields implementing complex programs and utilizing large datasets. Without access to the original code and data, it is often impossible to reproduce the findings in such papers. As such, certain tools have become essential to the paper generation and presentation. In this paper, I will examine a number of tools that aid in research reproducibility, and discuss their usage.
## Introduction

While generating a reproducible workflow may involve a wide variety of tools, there are a few which are extremely in modern research. In this paper, I will examine the following popular tools:

- Git/Github
- Markdown
- Makefiles
- pandoc

I will provide a brief discussion of the usage of each tool, and of how I used it in generating this document. By the end of the paper, you should have the necessary knowledge to generate a paper similar to this one.
