## Conclusions

I hope that this paper has given you a good introduction to each of these tools, and how each one can be used in the creation of reproducible research.

To prepare this paper, I mostly referred to the tutorials that I cited throughout the discussion section, at the end of the blurb on each tool.

The discussions on markdown and github were the easiest parts, since I had just done the markdown lab for this course, and have a good deal of experience with github.The git and makefile introductions were the most difficult parts, as I had to consider how I would try to explain `git` and `make` to people with no prior knowledge of them.

I didn't really get stuck at any point, since I have at least some experience with all of the tools I covered. The most time consuming parts were probably `git` and `make`, both because of the difficulty of covering them and because I tried to explain a somewhat large number of commands/syntax for each.

I worked on my own, consulting only the resources I listed throughout the paper, and your materials from Stat 159 (labs etc.). Looking at my commit history, it seems that the project took me about 8 hours to complete - three on one day, and five on another.
